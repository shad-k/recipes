Ingredients
350 g (12 oz) lamb or goat brain
1 onion, finely chopped
3 green chillis, sliced
4 tbsp plain yoghurt
2 tbsp ghee or vegetable oil
2 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp garlic & ginger paste
½ tsp chilli powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp turmeric
For garnish
Fresh coriander
Thin slices of fresh ginger
Garam masala

 
Instructions
Bring a pan of water with a pinch of turmeric to the boil. Add the brain and simmer for about 3 minutes to firm up the brain.
Drain the brains then chop coarsely into about 2 cm (¾") chunks.
Heat the ghee in a pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and sauté for about 6-7 minutes until the onions start to brown.
Add the spices and the garlic & ginger paste. Stir-fry for a further 2 minutes.
Add the chillis and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Mix in the yoghurt and continue to cook with stirring for 1 minute.
Add the brain and mix well. Continue to cook uncovered without stirring for a final 5-6 minutes.
Sprinkle on some garam masala, fresh coriander leaves and slices of fresh ginger to serve.
